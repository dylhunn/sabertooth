  "body": "### Big news: first stable release coming soon!\r\n\r\n### What is Sabertooth?\r\nSabertooth is a lightweight and open-source chess engine written in C. It is fully UCI-compatible, for use with your favorite chess GUI. It currently plays at moderate-to-amateur strength, and improves every day!\r\n\r\n### Is it compatible with my system?\r\nSabertooth works with Mac OS X or any 64-bit flavor of Unix/Linux. It doesn't presently support Windows, but this can be easily fixed (the only incompatible library is `POSIX threads`).\r\n\r\n### How can I get Sabertooth?\r\nDownload it using the link above! Since Sabertooth is a UCI engine and doesn't include a GUI, you will need your own. I recommend XBoard, which has an excellent Mac port.\r\n\r\nFirst, download the engine from the link above, and put it somewhere you'll remember. Then download the XBoard package for [Mac](http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=53680) or [Linux](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/#download).\r\n\r\nAfter you install XBoard, open it, and select from the menu Engine->Load New First Engine. In the dialog box, point XBoard to the directory of the engine file, like this:\r\n![Select the engine directory and name in XBoard](https://s31.postimg.org/chlv8zvhn/xboard_saber.png) \r\n\r\nBe sure you have checked the \"UCI\" box.\r\n\r\n### What's coming next?\r\nSabertooth doesn't currently support _en passant_, which is the next major release item.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSabertooth is developed by Dylan D. Hunn (@dylhunn).",
